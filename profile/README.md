## Hello, we're Box UK 👋

We are a bunch of award-winning 🏆 consultants, developers and designers making high performance digital products ✨

We've been doing this since **30 July, 1998** 🤯 and in our time we've been proud to produce fantastic products with our clients. Such as a global community hub for electronics engineers to exchange projects and ideas 💡, mobile optimised applications for medical professionals to access the best practices even while the wifis out 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️, and making interactive lessons like [battleships](https://www.boxuk.com/battleships/) to teach the value of rapid feedback 🚢

But we don't just build. We also offer a wide range of services from user experience sessions to help nail the execution of the next big thing :rocket: to workshops to help our clients be their best selves 💅

### Code with the universe ⭐️

Like most we'd be lost without amazing open source tools 🔧 that help support us to do our best work each day which is why we sponsor our favourite projects so they can continue to do their best work too 🤗

We also have our own home grown 🌱 projects developed from our own experience. You should definitely give them a try on your next project!

- [wp-project-skeleton](https://github.com/boxuk/wp-project-skeleton) - A kickstarter for your next WordPress project with all the best practices baked in from a fully dockerised setup to first class feature flag support. Oh my!
- [wp-hook-attributes](https://github.com/boxuk/wp-hook-attributes) - An simple method to attach PHP functions to WordPress hooks through annotations making it a piece of cake to add hooks.
- [wordpress-email-tld-checker](https://github.com/boxuk/wordpress-email-tld-checker) - Check email addresses for valid TLDs, great for helping keeping the spam out of the users database!
- [postcodes-io-bundle](https://github.com/boxuk/postcodes-io-bundle) - A symfony framework bundle that allows querying the [postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/) web service, making geo location using postcodes a cinch.

### A thousand words ✏️

When we're not writing code we're writing about it. Check out some of our recent highlights on the blog:

- [How we develop WordPress Sites](https://www.boxuk.com/insight/how-we-develop-wordpress-sites/) - a teardown on some lessons and best practices when it comes to building on the WordPress platform to give you the best foot forward
- [What is devops and how can it benefit you?](https://www.boxuk.com/insight/what-is-devops-and-how-can-it-benefit-your-business/)  - a common misconception is devops is a role, but it's so much more to it than that. We dig into what devops is and how it can help you build.
